ALX Polly allows authenticated users to create, share, and vote on polls. It's a simple yet powerful application that demonstrates key features of modern web development:

-   **Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login.
-   **Poll Management**: Users can create, view, and delete their own polls.
-   **Voting System**: A straightforward system for casting and viewing votes.
-   **User Dashboard**: A personalized space for users to manage their polls.
-   **QR Code Sharing**: Generate unique QR codes for easy poll sharing
-   **Real-time Results**: View live voting results as they come in

## Technology Stack

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Backend & Database**: [Supabase](https://supabase.io/)
-   **UI**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **State Management**: React Server Components and Client Components
-   **QR Generation**: qrcode.react library

## üöÄ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Here‚Äôs a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.

## Getting Started

To begin your security audit, you'll need to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account (the project is pre-configured, but you may need your own for a clean slate).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx-polly
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

The project uses Supabase for its backend. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

To get these values:
1. Go to your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
4. Copy the URL and anon/public key

### 4. Database Setup

1. Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to create the necessary tables:

```sql
-- Create polls table
CREATE TABLE polls (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    options TEXT[] NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create votes table
CREATE TABLE votes (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    poll_id UUID REFERENCES polls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    option_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE polls ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view all polls" ON polls FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own polls" ON polls FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own polls" ON polls FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own polls" ON polls FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view all votes" ON votes FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Users can create votes" ON votes FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id OR auth.uid() IS NULL);
```

### 5. Running the Development Server

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Poll

1. Register or login to your account
2. Navigate to the Dashboard
3. Click "Create Poll"
4. Enter your question and at least two options
5. Submit the form to create your poll
6. Share the unique poll URL or QR code with others

### Voting on a Poll

1. Open a shared poll link or scan the QR code
2. View the poll question and options
3. Select your preferred option
4. Submit your vote (anonymous voting is supported)
5. View real-time results

### Managing Your Polls

1. Go to your Dashboard to see all your created polls
2. View individual poll results with vote counts
3. Edit or delete your polls as needed
4. Monitor voting activity in real-time

## Testing the Application

To run tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Security Features

This application includes comprehensive security measures:

- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **Authentication**: Secure Supabase Auth integration
